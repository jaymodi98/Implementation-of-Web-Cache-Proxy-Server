# Implementation-of-Web-Cache-Proxy-Server
We have implemented a proxy server for web caching. We have implemented and compared 2 caching algorithms which include LRU(Least Recently Used) and LFU(Least Frequently Used). This was my project during the course of Computer Networks at SEAS, Ahmedabad University during Monsoon 2017 (Semester 5).

For the analysis part, we compared both the algorithms on the same sequences of requests and calculated Hits and Misses for different cache sizes. The "Analysis" folder contains the images for test results and codes for analyzing the algorithms.
